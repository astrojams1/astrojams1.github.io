    <h1>Data Logging</h1>
    <p class="large">Nothing happens unless absolutely necessary. That includes you being here. Since you are here, tell me about you.</p>
    <p>Smart people remind us that we can't control what we can't measure. Unfortunatley, good data is difficult to capture. In recent years, capturing some kinds of data has gotten eaiser (for example, fitness data), but capturing many other kinds of data is painful. For example, if you want to log every time you smoke a cigarette, how would you do it? Gross, that's a lot of steps. Our goal is to make the answer to that question, and every similar question "click once."</p>

    <p>This website is made by tweaking the minimum number of variables possible from all basic settings. I beleive in <b>Numinous Emergence</b>: That which ought to be is manifest through a collective vison.</p>
    <p>I have a cool and simple workflow for building this website. I have Atom to code and use its built-in git tools to push to my Github Page. I then auto-sync my GitHub Page with my personal domain (jham.es). When I make design tweaks, I push changes to prod and evaluate on the end product (rather than staging changes). Excuse the mess.</p>
