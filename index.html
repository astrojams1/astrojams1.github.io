    <p class="large">Nothing happens unless absolutely necessary. That includes you being here. Since you are here, tell me about you.</p>
    <p>Smart people like to remind us that we can't control what we can't measure. In recent years, capturing some kinds of data has gotten far eaiser (for example, many kinds of your fitness data), but capturing many other kinds of data about yourself remains pretty painful. It is still a pain to track our eating, for example. The goal is and must be to radically reduce friction to ingest good data.</p>
    <p class="small">This website is made by tweaking the minimum number of variables possible from all basic settings. I beleive in <b>Numinous Emergence</b>: That which ought to be becomes manifest through our collective envisioning. </p>
    <p class="small">I have a very simple workflow for building this website. I have Atom to code and use its built-in git tools to push to my Github Page. I then auto-sync my GitHub Page with my personal domain (jham.es). When I make design tweaks, I push changes to prod and evaluate on the end product (rather than staging changes). Excuse the mess.</p>
    <p class="small">I'm not a quantified self person. I'm not really a data nerd either. I like maps. I liked the Tufte books. I love design. I like art and animals and the Universe and its mysteries. I like mysteries and thinking things numinous, and myself as numinous.</p>
